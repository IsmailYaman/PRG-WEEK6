This was a school project where we covered different machine-learning methods.

With this project I have generated a decision tree that checks whether a mushroom is edible or not.
First I filtered out the data that I considered less important. I then sorted it and split it into two parts test and training data. I saved this data and then used it for my "application" that I made for it. I also made a confusion matrix for this.
